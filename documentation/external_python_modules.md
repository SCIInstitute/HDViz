# Python Modules
Custom Python modules can be called from the **dSpaceX** server to interpolate
and render models.

The examples used for the `nanoparticles_mesh` and `nanoparticles_volume`
datasets demonstrate custom external thumbnail rendering. The infrastructure for
custom model interpolation is very similar but still needs an example.

More documentation coming soon...
