## Overview
The Design Space Explorer facilitates decomposition, modeling, and deep exploration of multivariate datasets consisting of design parameters, quantities of interest, and shapes that represent these combinations. 


## Installation
Please see [Installing dSpaceX](documentation/INSTALL.md) to get things running.

## Using dSpaceX
The first step in using dSpaceX for exploration is to preprocess and load your datasets.  
Please see [dSpaceX Configuration](./documentation/configuration.md) to learn how to do this.  

Next, [start the server](documentation/server.md#running-the-server) and [open the web client](./client/README.md#running).  

Instructions for [Data Exploration using dSpaceX](documentation/using.md) can be found here.  

_Happy exploring!_

## Development
dSpaceX is under active development. To get started first build the server
**See [README.md in the client directory](./client/README.md)**

## Building the Client Code
